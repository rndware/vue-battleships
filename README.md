## Highlights

- Built with **Vue 3**, **Composition API** and **TypeScript**
- Architected scalable component library using **Atomic Design Principles** and **Single File Components (SFCs)**
- Engineered for high configurability
- Achieved comprehensive test coverage using **Vitest**
- Eliminated unnecessary third-party dependencies, reducing bundle size and minimising security vulnerabilities
- Seperated grid logic from `useBattleshipsGame` to be more **SOLID**
- Automatically switches between light and dark modes based upon system settings
- Optimized Vue components for brevity and clarity using slots where possible
- Includes immersive sound effects

## TO-DO

- Add `rgba` colors to CSS custom properties
- Rationalize unit usage (`rem` vs `px`) across the app
- Remove `any` types in unit tests

## Consider

- Converting `div` based grid to a `table` for accessibility
