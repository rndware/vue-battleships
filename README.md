- Clean, maintainable CSS using **BEM** and custom properties
- **Semantic design tokens** for a scalable design system

- Organized with the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) for scalable architecture
- Includes immersive sound effects
- Written in **TypeScript** for full type safety

TO-DO:

- Add `rgba` colors to CSS custom properties

Consider:
- Converting the `div`-based grid to a `table` for accessibility
